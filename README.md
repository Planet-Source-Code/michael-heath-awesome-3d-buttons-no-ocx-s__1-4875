## Awesome 3D Buttons\! No OCX's


</div>

### Description

This is great! A 3D button with no OCX's or API's. Every thing 3D on your forms is just an illusion. Well, this one is a great illusion. Anyone can do it. Just look at the code and you will see how to use it. One button is fixed, the other one you can resize and move. Uses a regular command button and some lines. I hope you enjoy and can use this code. Please leave me some comments on what you think. Any way to make it better with out making it into an OCX. And if you already know how to do something like this, great! I don't need to hear from you with how badly it was done. Just let it go. Anyway, the rest of you, enjoy the code!
